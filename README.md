# In-Memory-Database

- The InMemDB module is a module that I wrote using the combination of SQLAlchemy and pandas to easily create GUI-less in memory SQLite relational databases
- Returns a pandas DataFrame and can use all associated methods
- Can create, update, delete and query tables
- Tables can be created from pandas DataFrames, lists, and dictionaries
